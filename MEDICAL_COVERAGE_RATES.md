## Rate Comparison Guidelines

1. **Horse Value**: Higher value horses qualify for more options, including zero co-pay Classic Major Medical
2. **Discipline**: Sport Horses typically have slightly higher premiums than Western horses for Accelerant products
3. **Co-Pay Preference**: Zero co-pay options cost significantly more but provide better out-of-pocket protection
4. **Deductible Comfort**: Higher deductibles lower premiums but increase immediate out-of-pocket costs during claims
5. **Underwriting Platform**: Accelerant-only products often provide better terms (zero co-pay, zero deductible options)
6. **Limit Needs**: Higher limits provide more protection but increase premium costs

### Premium Savings Strategies
1. Choosing $1,000 deductible over $500 deductible saves approximately 12-15% on Classic Major Medical
2. Accepting 20% co-pay (vs 0%) can save 30-40% on Classic Major Medical premiums
3. Western horses have lower premiums than Sport Horses for Accelerant products (approximately 10% savings)
4. External Accident coverage costs significantly less than comprehensive medical coverage
